						Nathan Ingalls, known as DJ-Nate, is an American DJ and musical productor.
						He's a popular artist inside Geometry Dash, having 4 of his songs featured in the main levels
						and multiple more being used by the users in custom levels.
					</p>
					<p>
						He was born on March 5th, 1991, in Chicago, Illinois. He started producing music on 2005.
						However, it wasn't until 2010 where he published his first hit: Electrodynamix, which eventually would find its way into Geometry Dash,
						being his third song to achieve that after Theory of Everything and <a href="">Clubstep</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						On 2015, after an update to the game that allowed custom songs to be used on levels, his popularity exploded once more.
						Lots of players started using his songs on their own levels, some of which became icons of the game, and even before that, his song Clubstep was already being inmortalized
						in the minds of players
					</p>
					<p>
						He mostly stopped publishing music after 2018, with his last relevant song being <a href=""><span style="color: BLUE;">Final Theory</span></a>, the fourth and last part of his
						<a href="">Theory</a> <a href="">of</a> <a href="">Everything</a> series, released on March 9th, 2020.
